# Data Processing for OsciSenForce 
The following software controls the OsciSenForce testing system (VTE Therapy Device Testing Tool) at OsciFlex. This software is written in Python for the processing and "user interface" sides, while C++ is used for data collection. Output from OsciSenForce is detected in the hardware_code.ino file and passed through the Serial monitor to the data collection python file. These two files communicate via the Serial monitor to ensure that correct connection to the OsciSenForce device is established, regardless of the computer used. The raw data is directed to and output folder, if it has not already been created. The final script takes from the raw data from the output folder and formats it into an understandable graph for the user.
